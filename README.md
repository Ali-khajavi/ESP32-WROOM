# ESP32-WROOM Projects  

This repository contains a collection of projects and examples designed for the ESP32-WROOM microcontroller. The ESP32-WROOM is a powerful and versatile module that supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and a wide range of peripheral interfaces, making it ideal for IoT, automation, and embedded systems applications.  

## Features  

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-WROOM module with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support  
- **Programming Language**: C/C++  
- **IDE**: Arduino IDE or other compatible IDEs (e.g., PlatformIO, ESP-IDF)  
- **Libraries**: Integration with commonly used libraries for sensors, displays, communication protocols, and more  

## Repository Structure  

- `/examples/`: This folder will soon include example projects to help you get started with ESP32-WROOM development. Stay tuned!  
- `/docs/`: Documentation and tutorials for using the ESP32-WROOM module in various applications (to be updated).  
- `/src/`: Source code for custom projects, configurations, and experiments with the ESP32-WROOM.  

## Getting Started  

### Requirements  

- **Hardware**: ESP32-WROOM module, USB cable, and additional peripherals depending on your project (e.g., sensors, displays, actuators).  
- **Software**:  
  - Arduino IDE with the ESP32 core installed.  
  - Required libraries (listed in the examples or project-specific documentation).  

### Setup  

1. **Install the ESP32 Core**: Follow the [official guide](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32#installation-instructions) to set up ESP32 support in Arduino IDE.  
2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Khajavi/ESP32-WROOM.git  
   cd ESP32-WROOM
